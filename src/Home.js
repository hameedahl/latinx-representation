                <p>Since the early 50s, when televisions became a staple in American homes, the 
                   government and show producers used it as a medium to establish what being American 
                   looks and sounds like. By analyzing episodes and discourse around these shows, 
                   this project will explore the evolution of Latinx representation in American 
                   sitcoms as well as the mannerisms and ideologies producers aimed to instill.
