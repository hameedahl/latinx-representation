        ],
        "analysis": 
            <p>The show's typical trope was to depict Cisco as the brave, intelligent, and honest hero and Pancho 
                as the timid, unintelligent, and less moral sidekick. Through the duo's bodies, clothes, and accents, 
                the showrunners contrast Cisco and Pancho, placing Cisco on a much higher pedestal than Pancho. 
                This difference is significant because how the viewers perceive the characters is how they will perceive 
                the group they are trying to represent. Cisco is said to be of Spanish-Mexican descent, and Pancho is 
                Mexican American. Cisco is much thinner and fitter, does all the fighting, and gets all the praise. 
                His clothes are nicer, with an embroidered jacket, bolo tie, and "tight-cut pants of the Mexican charro 
                (Beltràn 26)." His light accents and clothes make him look like an American dressing up. Not to mention, 
                Duncan Renaldo is Romain-American, and Carrillo is Spanish-American, taking away their characters' 
                authenticity because, as we'll see in later shows, being in touch with your character is more effective 
                than pretending to be.<br/><br/>
            
                On the other hand, Pancho is chubbier, and his "cowboy or vaquero outfit" is simple and low-quality 
                (Beltrán 26). He has a strong accent and butchers his English. In many of the episodes I watched, 
                he says things like, "Let's went," instead of "Let's go," or "Don't you realize me?" instead of 
                "Don't you recognize me?" In Clip #1, "he says, "Qué vergüenza. I know I must remember something, 
                but I forget to remember (00:17 - 00:21)." Moreover, it's interesting that Pancho's hat is much 
                larger than Cisco's, making him look frivolous and adding to Pancho's lightheartedness. This 
                depiction also let viewers know that he is the butt of the joke and they should not take him 
                seriously. Even their horses' names reflect this: Pancho's horse is named "Loco," and Cisco's is 
                "Diablo." Besides adding to the humor, the difference in hat sizes may also subtly reinforce 
                Mexican stereotypes of clownish depictions. <br/><br/>
        
                By illustrating Pancho this way, the showrunners develop the idea of Mexican Americans as 
                unintelligent, lazy, unable to speak English, and thieves. This portrayal reflects the 
                "sidekick" stereotype, where Latina/o characters are often used for humor, sometimes at the expense 
                of their dignity. Next to Pancho, Cisco functions as the "model" Spanish-Mexican American. The 
                showrunners want Latina/o viewers to see Cisco as someone to work toward. They also develop unrealistic 
                and unfair expectations that non-Latina/o viewers will have for Latinas/os. <br/><br/>
        
                However, the show does a good job of ridding some stereotypes. For example, the writers mainly 
                based most episodes on someone framing the duo for theft or murder and them trying to prove their 
                innocence. Although it does emphasize the typical bandit stereotype often associated with Mexican 
                characters in early television, these plots also challenge it. </p>

        "analysis": 
            <p>With Arnaz holding most of the creative control and playing a character so close to 
               himself, <em>I Love Lucy</em> demonstrates an overall positive representation of Latinas/os 
               and effectively mixes Cuban and American cultures. Unlike <em>The Cisco Kid</em>, where the 
               showrunners create humor from Pancho's clothes, accent, and intelligence in exchange for his 
               dignity, <em>I Love Lucy</em> constructs "multilingual humor" by evenly distributing it between Spanish and English domains (Kirschen 4). 
               Specifically, "the monolingual ignorance of Lucy is inferior to Ricky's control of both languages, 
               thus enabling him to craft the humor (Kirschen 12)." We see this point in Clip #2, and this notion 
               of superiority also introduces an advantage the show gives Spanish-speaking viewers, which we 
               will explore heavily in <em>¿Què Pasa, U.S.A?</em>. <br /><br />

              "Cuban Pals," perfectly illustrates a common motif Lucy and Dezi articulate in the show: "bilingual 
              cleverness often plays the monolingual as inferior (Kirschen 13)." In many episodes, Lucy is embarrassed 
              because she cannot speak Spanish, leaving her and even the audience excluded from a conversation. 
              However, Ricky never really finds himself in a similar situation. Sure, he has his accent and makes a 
              few mistakes here and there, but he can act as Lucy's translator and is much better about languages 
              than Lucy, who puts minimal effort into learning Spanish. She is seemingly so against the language 
              that the thought of teaching their child it appalls her. <br /><br />
            
              "Lucy Hires An English Tutor," is a particularly interesting and complex episode, and I love the 
              writers' approach of putting all the characters and their languages on a somewhat even level. Even 
              though the audience might see Ricky needing the most help, the tutor also points out problems with Lucy, 
              Fred, and Ethel's speech. Moreover, we can understand the audience's background by analyzing their 
              laughter: they mainly found Lucy's jokes about Ricky's English funnier than Ricky's comments about how 
              much better Spanish is, suggesting the audience mainly speaks English. <br /><br />
            
              Similarly, the show manages to emphasize non-Latina/o American's lack of knowledge about other cultures 
              and languages. For example, I was surprised to see how confused the tutor was about Ricky's vernacular 
              in Clip #7. When Ricky spoke, the tutor looked at him like he was speaking Spanish. He didn't even know of 
              the Spanish vowels—it's like Latinas/os don't even exist outside of the Ricardos' living room. It shows 
              how much Lucy and Ricky are in their own world, and it reminded me that just because stereotypes, 
              racism, and underrepresentation are almost nonexistent in their world, it is still very much present 
              on the outside.

            <p><em>Chico and the Man</em> negatively depict Mexican-Americans as desperate, deceitful, and inferior as Chico 
               spends the entire first two episodes trying to get a job from Ed, a discriminatory and racist white man, 
               even if it means losing his dignity in the process. Throughout the first episode, Ed says hurtful 
               things to Chico, calling him a "street bum," saying he has "flies," and constantly insinuating he 
               wants Chico dead and gone. The yellow jumpsuit Chico is wearing in clip #5 says "Ed's Garbage" on the 
               back, a harmful typo Chico's cousin made. Through it all, Chico still stays with Ed and endures it. <br /><br /> 

               However, Chico's uplifting personality obscures the series' questionable narrative by incorporating ethnic 
               humor, ultimately inviting Mexican-Americans into the show and giving them much-needed recognition. Chico's 
               jokes are in touch with Chicana/o experiences, and the ones who get it see the humor in it—for example, 
               Chico's comments about the culture around tequila and religion. Instead of including jokes that laugh 
               <em>at Latinas/os</em>, as we saw in previous shows, the series uses jokes that laugh <em>with Latinas/os</em>. <br /><br />
            
               Moreover, Chico relates to viewers by highlighting real injustices only Chicanas/os would understand. 
               For example, Chico constantly reminds Ed and audience members like him that they are the same—they talk 
               to the same God, live in the same neighborhood, fight for the same democracy, etc. Chico even says he 
               doesn't want a job; he wants to "belong" and be on "a team," indirectly referencing one of the motivations 
               behind the Chicano movement.</p>

        "analysis": 
            <p>The bilingual nature of <em>¿Qué Pasa, U.S.A.?</em> makes it accessible to a broader 
               audience, teaching both Spanish and English monolinguals while also rewarding bilingual 
               viewers. For example, bilingual viewers have an enriched experience as they can catch 
               phrases that get lost in translation, enhancing the humor. Sharon represents English 
               monolinguals, while Carmen and Joe's parents and grandparents stand for Spanish monolinguals. 
               Through translations of conversations for Sharon and the grandparents, the characters indirectly 
               teach viewers about both languages and Latina/o and American cultures. For instance, Sharon compares 
               quinceañeras to sweet sixteen parties, helping Latina/o immigrants relate to American culture. <br /><br />

               Additionally, Sharon's character represents how Latinas/os may perceive Americans who lack knowledge about 
               Latina/o culture. She usually becomes the punchline, encouraging viewers who might share her confusion to 
               confront their own ignorance. Moreover, the series' bicultural success is also because it addresses 
               relatable issues, such as the younger generation's struggle to maintain connections with their Cuban 
               roots—a problem all immigrants face. This disconnect often leads to the use of Spanglish and challenges 
               in communicating with older generations, making the show especially applicable to its target audience of 
               Cuban immigrants.</p>

        "analysis": 
            <p>This series adopts a more natural and unforced approach, as Lopez shares his 
               personal stories "as opposed to merely being depicted through others' visions 
               (Bèltran 6)." The characters only reference their Mexican or Cuban heritage 
               when making jokes or in the few episodes focused on it. This approach is 
               interesting because it illustrates that authentic representation is 
               sufficient to satisfy Latina/o viewers. <br /><br />

               The series combines successful elements from previous shows while omitting 
               those that did not work. For instance, George relies heavily on ethnic humor, 
               like Chico, crafting jokes that resonate with Latinas/os rather than making 
               fun of them. Additionally, the family dynamics and conflicts resemble those 
               in ¿Què Pasa, U.S.A?, addressing real issues such as Carmen's acts of rebellion, 
               Max's learning disabilities, struggles with in-laws, work challenges, and 
               experiences of discrimination. <br /><br />
            
               As a viewer, it feels like watching a typical American sitcom where the family 
               happens to be Latina/o. The characters rarely speak Spanish, lack accents, and 
               have no Latina/o decorations around the house (Market 156). While these aspects 
               help to reduce stereotypes about Latinas/os speaking English, they can also 
               reinforce harmful biases against those who primarily speak Spanish. </p>
